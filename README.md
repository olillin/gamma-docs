# Gamma Documentation

## About this Document

This document is is aimed at developers looking to use the Gamma API to
provide their users with the ability to login with Gamma or to fetch data from
the Gamma API in general.

It was written by Cal (Oliver Lindell) to demistify how to use and integrate
with Gamma after painstakingly trying to figure it out without documentation.
