# Allow List API

**API Key Type**: `ALLOW_LIST`  

## What is the allow list?

The allow list is a list of **cid**s (Chalmers IDs) which are allowed to create
a Gamma account. This is to limit Gamma account creation to members of the
Software Engineering Student Division (IT).

When a new year of students enroll at the Software Engineering programme they
are added to the allow list and they can create a Gamma account.
